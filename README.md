# classlinkv2

Alternate ClassLink frontend without the bloat.

Made in [dreamlandjs](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/dreamlandjs) with the [m3-dreamland](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/m3-dreamland) component library.

Uses [Wisp](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-protocol) and [epoxy-tls](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/epoxy-tls) to communicate end-to-end encrypted with the ClassLink API.
